# secretary_problem
codes related to my thesis,

it includes dynamic programming algorithm which solves general secretary problem with given payoffs (like classic secretary problem, minimize the expected rank, pick prime ranks etc.

there are more numerical functions which approximate the optimal thresholds or the optimal success probability for k-th best secretary or one of top k secretaries.
